# Changelog

All notable changes to the **`local_su_statboard_api`** plugin are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.4] — 2026-06-26

### Changed

- **Issue #4 (HIGH)**: live `max_connections` (today's count) no longer queries
  `{logstore_standard_log}`. It now reads `{user}.lastaccess` (≤ 50k rows,
  indexed), consistent with the existing `users_online_now` pattern. Zero
  runtime queries on the logstore from the API endpoint.
- **Issue #4 (HIGH)**: hourly aggregation cron switched from
  `eventname NOT LIKE '%webservice%'` to an exact
  `eventname = '\core\event\user_loggedin'` filter (indexed), for
  consistency with the daily cron and faster execution.
- **Issue #7 (LOW)**: external service implementation moved from legacy
  `externallib.php` to the modern namespaced
  `classes/external/get_statboard_stats.php`
  (`\local_su_statboard_api\external\get_statboard_stats::execute()`).
  The web service function name remains
  `local_su_statboard_api_get_statboard_stats` — no client change required.

### Removed

- `externallib.php` (replaced by the namespaced class above).

## [1.0.3] — 2026-06-17

### Changed (breaking)

- **Minimum Moodle version raised to 4.2** (`2023042400+`). Moodle 4.1 LTS reached its
  end-of-extended-support in December 2025; this release uses the modern
  `\core_external\util` API introduced in 4.2 which avoids PHPUnit isolation issues
  during installation. Users on Moodle 4.1 should stay on plugin v1.0.2 or upgrade Moodle first.

### Changed (breaking, fixed by automatic upgrade)

- **Tables renamed to follow the Frankenstyle convention** (`plugintype_pluginname_tablename`):
  - `su_statboard_daily_stats` → `local_su_statboard_api_day`
  - `su_statboard_hourly_stats` → `local_su_statboard_api_hour`

  (Short suffixes used because Moodle's `sql_generator` enforces a 28-character table-name limit for Oracle compatibility.)
  - Existing installations are migrated automatically by `db/upgrade.php` — no manual action required.

### Fixed

- **Security (BLOCKER)**: added `self::validate_context()` call in `get_statboard_stats()` (Moodle external service guideline).
- **Security**: replaced two `PARAM_RAW` by `PARAM_TEXT` for submit-button parameters in `token_settings.php`.
- **Best practice**: use `get_config()` instead of direct DML on `{config_plugins}` in the uninstaller.

### Removed

- Dead cache definition `statboard_hourly` that was declared but never used. `hourly_connections` reads directly from the aggregated summary table (≤ 24 rows per call, already instant).

### Added

- GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) running Moodle Plugin CI across Moodle 4.2 → 4.5, PHP 8.0 → 8.3, PostgreSQL and MariaDB (12 jobs).
- `db/upgrade.php` with the v1.0.3 table-rename migration block.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Plugin renamed from `local_su_dashboard_api` to `local_su_statboard_api`.
- Documentation overhaul: `DEVELOPERS_fr.md` and `DEVELOPERS_en.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE` (GPL v3).
- Full Moodle CodeChecker compliance (0 errors, 0 warnings).
- PHPUnit test suite (external, privacy provider, daily aggregation task).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added

- Initial public release of the Statboard API plugin.
- Single REST web service `local_su_statboard_api_get_statboard_stats` returning a complete metric set in one call:
  - `total_users` — active users (not deleted, not suspended).
  - `total_courses` — number of courses excluding the front page.
  - `users_online_now` — real users active in the last 5 minutes (excludes `webservice` and `nologin` accounts).
  - `max_connections` — daily login peak over the last 30 days, with date.
  - `hourly_connections` — hourly snapshot of distinct active users.
  - `quiz_completed_today` — finished quiz attempts of the day.
- MUC cache strategy with per-metric TTL (`statboard_totals` 1 h, `statboard_max` 15 min, `statboard_quiz` 5 min); `users_online_now` always live; `hourly_connections` read directly from the summary table.
- Two scheduled tasks (`blocking=1` for cluster safety):
  - `\local_su_statboard_api\task\aggregate_daily_stats` — nightly login aggregation (00:05).
  - `\local_su_statboard_api\task\aggregate_hourly_stats` — hourly snapshot aggregation (HH:01).
- Two custom tables `su_statboard_daily_stats` (≤ 30 rows) and `su_statboard_hourly_stats` (≤ 720 rows) populated by the cron, with automatic 30-day rolling purge.
- Automated installer that creates the dedicated webservice user, attaches the manager role, registers the external service and generates a permanent token.
- Automated uninstaller that performs full cleanup of users, tokens, services and configuration.
- Token management UI (`token_settings.php`) with regeneration, expiration toggle, automatic detection and correction of inconsistencies between configuration and database state.
- Read-only token consultation page (`view_token.php`).
- Two capabilities: `local/su_statboard_api:view` and `local/su_statboard_api:managetokensettings`.
- Full Privacy API implementation covering metadata declaration, user data export and deletion (single user, multiple users, all users in context).
- Custom event `\local_su_statboard_api\event\stats_viewed` fired on every API call for audit purposes.
- Multi-database support: PostgreSQL 12+, MySQL 5.7.33+, MariaDB 10.6+. Installation aborts with a clear error on unsupported databases (MSSQL, Oracle, SQLite).
- Localised in 7 languages: English (reference), French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese (Portugal), Portuguese (Brazil).
- Portable SQL helpers (`local_su_statboard_api_get_db_compatible_sql`) that branch between PostgreSQL and MySQL/MariaDB syntax for date and hour operations.

### Compatibility

- Requires Moodle 4.1 or later (`2022112800+`).
